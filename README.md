## Usage Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start with Dashboard**: Get overall program overview
2. **Check Monthly Tracking**: View temporal distribution of activities
3. **Review ITT**: Monitor performance against indicators
4. **Dive into ATT**: See detailed activity implementation
5. **Use Exports**: Generate reports for donors/stakeholders

### Data Entry
1. Select project and indicator from dropdowns
2. Enter activity code (e.g., 3.2.1, 3.2.4)
3. Fill disaggregation data (system auto-calculates totals)
4. Verify nationality totals match refugee count
5. Add budget, narrative, and attachments
6. Submit (in full system, would save to database)

### Monitoring Workflow
1. **Weekly**: Review active cases in Case Management
2. **Monthly**: Check Monthly Tracking for activity distribution
3. **Quarterly**: Export ITT and ATT for donor reports
4. **Annual**: Use Dashboard export for comprehensive overview
